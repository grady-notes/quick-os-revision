# Distributed Operating System

Multiple central processors are used by Distributed systems to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users. Accordingly, Data processing jobs are distributed among the processors.

Processors communicate with each other through various communication lines (like high-speed buses or telephone lines). These are known as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. Processors in this system may vary in size and function. They are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and so on.

# Advantages Distributed Operating System

- With resource sharing facility, a user at one site may be able to use the resources available at another.

- Speedup the exchange of data with one another via electronic mail.

- Failure of one site in a distributed system doesnâ€™t affect the others, the remaining sites can potentially continue operating.

- Better service to the customers.

- Reduction of the load on the host computer.

- Reduction of delays in data processing.
