# Realtime Operating Systems

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are used in environments where a large number of events, mostly external to the computer system, must be accepted and processed in a short time or within certain deadlines. such applications are industrial control, telephone switching equipment, flight control, and real-time simulations. With an RTOS, the processing time is measured in tenths of seconds. This system is time-bound and has a fixed deadline. The processing in this type of system must occur within the specified constraints. Otherwise, This will lead to system failure.

# Types of RTOS

## Hard Real-Time Operating System

These operating systems guarantee that critical tasks be completed within a range of time.
For example, a robot is hired to weld a car body. If the robot welds too early or too late, the car cannot be sold, so it is a hard real-time system that requires complete car welding by robot hardly on the time.

## Soft Real-Time Operating System

This operating system provides some relaxation in the time limit.
For example â€“ Multimedia systems, digital audio systems etc. Explicit, programmer-defined and controlled processes are encountered in real-time systems. A separate process is changed with handling a single external event. The process is activated upon occurrence of the related event signalled by an interrupt.

## Firm Real-Time Operating System

RTOS of this type have to follow deadlines as well. In spite of its small impact, missing a deadline can have unintended consequences, including a reduction in the quality of the product. Example: Multimedia applications.
