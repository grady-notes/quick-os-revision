# Time Sharing Operating System

A time sharing operating system is a type of operating system that allows multiple processes to share a single processor. This is done by scheduling processes to run on the processor. Along with the scheduling, the operating system also provides a mechanism for processes to share resources, such as memory, disk, or network bandwidth.
Each action or order at a time the shared system becomes smaller, so only a little CPU time is required for each user. As the system rapidly switches from one user to another, each user is given the impression that the entire computer system is dedicated to its use, although it is being shared among multiple users.

A time shared operating system uses CPU scheduling and multi-programming to provide each with a small portion of a shared computer at once. Each user has at least one separate program in memory. A program loaded into memory and executes, it performs a short period of time either before completion or to complete I/O.This short period of time during which user gets attention of CPU is known as time slice, time slot or quantum.It is typically of the order of 10 to 100 milliseconds. Time shared operating systems are more complex than multiprogrammed operating systems. In both, multiple jobs must be kept in memory simultaneously, so the system must have memory management and security. To achieve a good response time, jobs may have to swap in and out of disk from main memory which now serves as a backing store for main memory. A common method to achieve this goal is virtual memory, a technique that allows the execution of a job that may not be completely in memory.
