# Multiprogramming

Multi-programming is the ability to run multiple programs at the same time. In other words, the concurrent resident of multiple programs in the current computer memory is referred to as multiprogramming. In multiprogramming, a program can be executed simultaneously with other programs. Although multiple programs can run together, only one program can be executed at a time. This is why multiprogramming is called concurrent multiprogramming and takes a significantly longer time to execute than single-programming.
